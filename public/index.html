        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            For this project, I will conduct spectral analysis of Bb clarinet multiphonics and other extended techniques and create an online resource to encourage a productive discourse regarding a pedagogical/educational and conceptual outlet for contemporary techniques. My intended audience for this project includes myself, the clarinet studio at Arizona State University, and fellow clarinet colleagues and enthusiasts around the world. Myself because I am looking to exercise my current acoustical understanding of the instrument and witness a representation of my theoretical knowledge in action. This includes how clarinet multiphonics and extended techniques are mechanically accomplished through fingerings and embouchure voicing. In addition, I am looking to exercise my own findings and analysis in contemporary repertoire performances. The clarinet studio and others around the world are my primary audience in creating this online database/foundation for clarinettists to communicate and share ideas. This database will include components for clear interpretation and manipulation in addition to a set of comment thread to encourage posts on personal findings and additional information. Feel free to comment below any thoughts or questions you might have!

        <h2>Production of Single Sounds and Multiple Sounds on Bb Clarinet</h2>
        <p>
            To understand how contemporary extended techniques are produced, we must first understand the acoustics of a Bb clarinet and the production of single sounds. The clarinet is a closed cylindrical system with an open (bell) and closed (mouthpiece) end. The reed, located at the closed end, acts as an oscillator and allows energy to be released into the system. After the initial energy reflects back onto the reed, a low energy closes the reed inward and shut. Another repetition of this cycle allows a high energy to reflect back to the closed end of the system and open the reed. This system repeats.
        </p>
        <p>
            The harmonic series are a set of sounds that naturally occur in nature, where the frequency of each sound in the set is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. Single sounds on a clarinet are determined by two factors: the effective tube length in which the air/energy has to travel and the vibration modes that are created by oral cavity or vocal fold manipulations along the vocal tract, known as voicing. Multiple sounds or other extended techniques include an physical/mechanical alteration to either of these two factors. With the Bb clarinet being a closed cylindrical system, only the odd harmonics acoustically exist in the production of sound. This allows the partial above the resonating fundamental frequency to sound a Perfect 12th higher, skipping the Perfect octave partial that naturally occurs in the overtone/harmonic series.
        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is a prime example of how microtones are achieved through cross fingerings and altering the effective tube length. Switching from |1 2 on the right hand to |1 3 creates a tuning disparity between the two sounds. Some of the air or energy now has to travel a different distance as tone hole 3 on the right hand is closed. This raises the pitch and gives the rough notation of Fb (half). The spear graph (measuring pitch in hertz on the y axis and duration in seconds on the x axis) visually confirms the slight alteration of the fundamental and its consequent partials above, moving in parallel whole integer motion regarding the harmonic/overtone series of the instrument. This microtone can be easily reproduced as the notation shows the fingering chart alterations as the only mechanical difference to produce the slight change in pitch.

                        <p>
                            This example splits the movement from F# to F, typically only in two equidistant notes with the presence of semitones, into four equidistant notes. Closing tone holes further down the instrument is changing the effective tube length where the air/energy has to travel. Each iteration adds another fingering down the instrument, bringing the original pitch lower. As with many of these technique examples, the notation doesn’t accurately define the intervallic relationships, but instead a general description and direction of the pitch alteration. The spear graph shows the fundamental frequency staying relatively constant, with the partials above moving slightly downward with each fingering change. This microtone is a bit more difficult to reproduce as the notation isn’t accurately noting the intervallic relationships.

                            Similar to Microtone one, this is a prime example in relating a microphone to a reference pitch that is acoustically designed and sound for the instrument. The movement from the Bb to the Cb (half) allows parallel movement of the fundamental frequency and its respective partials. This microtone can be easily reproduced as the notation shows the fingering chart alterations as the only mechanical difference to produce the slight change in pitch.

                        These next three techniques show a manipulation of the effective tube length. For the upper joint, there aren’t many large disparities in pitch when compared to sounds created with the upper joint on the full instrument. The lower joint is a prime example of how changing the effective tube length causes alterations in pitch and intervallic relationships between notes.
