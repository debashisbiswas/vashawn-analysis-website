        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            For this project, I will conduct spectral analysis of Bb clarinet multiphonics and other extended techniques and create an online resource to encourage a productive discourse regarding a pedagogical/educational and conceptual outlet for contemporary techniques. My intended audience for this project includes myself, the clarinet studio at Arizona State University, and fellow clarinet colleagues and enthusiasts around the world. Myself because I am looking to exercise my current acoustical understanding of the instrument and witness a representation of my theoretical knowledge in action. This includes how clarinet multiphonics and extended techniques are mechanically accomplished through fingerings and embouchure voicing. In addition, I am looking to exercise my own findings and analysis in contemporary repertoire performances. The clarinet studio and others around the world are my primary audience in creating this online database/foundation for clarinettists to communicate and share ideas. This database will include components for clear interpretation and manipulation in addition to a set of comment thread to encourage posts on personal findings and additional information. Feel free to comment below any thoughts or questions you might have!

        <h2>Brief History of Bb Clarinet Multiphonics and Exploration of Extended Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            The first entry for multiphonics was by Antonio Ferrannini in <i>Ancie battenti</i> (1943). A more detailed exploration of multiphonics came from Bruno Bartolozzi in <i>New Sounds for Woodwind</i> (1967). One of the first recorded uses of multiphonics in performance is from Eric Dolphy and his work in the jazz bebop and free jazz eras of the mid-20th century. While not notated and used in improvisational contexts, this sparked interest for composers on how to attain more notational and acoustical control of such unpredictable sounds. Difficult to notate, many composers choose a fingering diagram positioned vertically above or below the set of sonorities and the indicated harmonics to produce above the given fundamental.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flutter tonguing, a popular contemporary technique used in solo repertoire, has been notated before the 19th century, with Johann Strauss II’s <i>Don Quixote</i> and Pytor Llyich Tchaikovsky’s <i>The Nutcracker</i>. This technique is typically notated with an expression text abbreviation of fltz. or multiple slash marks on the stems. Effective uses of flutter tongue achieve a greater intensity in the phrase or a blurred, fleeting texture. Teeth on the reed is a non-traditional effect first seen in Donald Scavarda’s <i>Matrix for Clarinetist</i> (1962). One option for notation of teeth on reed includes Helmet Lachenmann’s slashes on the stem and a “z” for the notehead. In William O. Smith’s <i>Epigrams for Clarinets</i>, he notates for teeth on reed at the end of movement one as an open triangle with a footnote. The glissando/portamento/pitch bend is a popular extended technique that has existed for multiple musical eras of the 19th and 20th century. Ronald Caravan defines this as “the connection of two tones by a smooth slide which passes through all of the possible pitches or frequencies between the two tones without interruption”. Notational possibilities of glissandos/portamentos/pitch bends can include relative duration and pitch accuracies. Popular use of this set of techniques include George Gershwin’s <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i> (1924) clarinet opening or anywhere in Scott McAllister’s <i>Freebirds for Two Solo Clarinets and Wind Orchestra</i> (2009). Slap tongue is an effect originating from the traditional jazz era. The first record of this technique was by Stump Evans, a saxophone player in King Oliver’s Creole Band. While this traditional era of jazz was in the 1920s, bebop and free jazz woodwind musicians, such as Coleman Hawkins and Eric Dolphy, included slap tonguing in their improvisational toolbelt. Notation for this extended articulation includes a wide range of symbols positioned vertically above the note or a visual alteration of the notehead, such as an “x” as the notehead or a plus sign “+” positioned above the note.
        </p>
        <p>
            Respective joints are contemporary techniques that show a manipulation of the effective tube length. This includes playing the upper and lower joints of the clarinet separate and together. In the appendix on William O. Smith’s inspiration for entering the contemporary composition field, a performance of Berio’s <i>Sequenza I</i> for flute, where a dyad multiphonic was used, sparked Smith’s interest in the creation of multiple sonorities on clarinet. Pieces using these techniques include William O. Smith’s <i>Epigrams for Clarinets</i> and <i>Four Duets for Four DemiClarinets.</i>

        <h2>Production of Single Sounds and Multiple Sounds on Bb Clarinet</h2>
        <p>
            To understand how contemporary extended techniques are produced, we must first understand the acoustics of a Bb clarinet and the production of single sounds. The clarinet is a closed cylindrical system with an open (bell) and closed (mouthpiece) end. The reed, located at the closed end, acts as an oscillator and allows energy to be released into the system. After the initial energy reflects back onto the reed, a low energy closes the reed inward and shut. Another repetition of this cycle allows a high energy to reflect back to the closed end of the system and open the reed. This system repeats.
        </p>
        <p>
            The harmonic series are a set of sounds that naturally occur in nature, where the frequency of each sound in the set is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. Single sounds on a clarinet are determined by two factors: the effective tube length in which the air/energy has to travel and the vibration modes that are created by oral cavity or vocal fold manipulations along the vocal tract, known as voicing. Multiple sounds or other extended techniques include an physical/mechanical alteration to either of these two factors. With the Bb clarinet being a closed cylindrical system, only the odd harmonics acoustically exist in the production of sound. This allows the partial above the resonating fundamental frequency to sound a Perfect 12th higher, skipping the Perfect octave partial that naturally occurs in the overtone/harmonic series.
        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is a prime example of how microtones are achieved through cross fingerings and altering the effective tube length. Switching from |1 2 on the right hand to |1 3 creates a tuning disparity between the two sounds. Some of the air or energy now has to travel a different distance as tone hole 3 on the right hand is closed. This raises the pitch and gives the rough notation of Fb (half). The spear graph (measuring pitch in hertz on the y axis and duration in seconds on the x axis) visually confirms the slight alteration of the fundamental and its consequent partials above, moving in parallel whole integer motion regarding the harmonic/overtone series of the instrument. This microtone can be easily reproduced as the notation shows the fingering chart alterations as the only mechanical difference to produce the slight change in pitch.

                        <p>
                            This example splits the movement from F# to F, typically only in two equidistant notes with the presence of semitones, into four equidistant notes. Closing tone holes further down the instrument is changing the effective tube length where the air/energy has to travel. Each iteration adds another fingering down the instrument, bringing the original pitch lower. As with many of these technique examples, the notation doesn’t accurately define the intervallic relationships, but instead a general description and direction of the pitch alteration. The spear graph shows the fundamental frequency staying relatively constant, with the partials above moving slightly downward with each fingering change. This microtone is a bit more difficult to reproduce as the notation isn’t accurately noting the intervallic relationships.

                            Similar to Microtone one, this is a prime example in relating a microphone to a reference pitch that is acoustically designed and sound for the instrument. The movement from the Bb to the Cb (half) allows parallel movement of the fundamental frequency and its respective partials. This microtone can be easily reproduced as the notation shows the fingering chart alterations as the only mechanical difference to produce the slight change in pitch.

                            This is a prime example of how microtones are achieved through cross fingerings and altering the effective tube length. Switching from |1 2 on the right hand to |1 3 creates a tuning disparity between the two sounds. Some of the air or energy now has to travel a different distance as tone hole 3 on the right hand is closed. This raises the pitch and gives the rough notation of Fb (half). The spear graph (measuring pitch in hertz on the y axis and duration in seconds on the x axis) visually confirms the slight alteration of the fundamental and its consequent partials above, moving in parallel whole integer motion regarding the harmonic/overtone series of the instrument. This microtone can be easily reproduced as the notation shows the fingering chart alterations as the only mechanical difference to produce the slight change in pitch.

                        <p>
                            This multiphonic has two sounding sonorities at the same time. This multiphonic is relatively easy to produce as there is only a slight tongue manipulation from how you currently voice the A6. The middle/back of my tongue raises up a bit more to achieve a clear dynamic for both sonorities. Allowing less air/energy into the system means that both notes may not be well and equally supported with each other. In this case, further oral manipulation can occur.

                            This overblowing technique, allowing more energy into the system than needed (in addition to an oral manipulation of moving your tongue up and forward), produces the next available partial in the harmonic/overtone series. The spear graph shows the heavy presence of the upper partials in this excerpt. This technique can be a bit difficult to produce due to the voicing manipulations.

                            This growling technique allows you to excite the upper partials with control of oral manipulation. The spear graph shows the fundamental frequency staying constant. Through only voicing manipulations (no change in fingering or outer embouchure), you can excite different vibrational modes and allow different partials to sound. This technique is relatively difficult to reproduce as the production of sound takes a great deal of control regarding tongue manipulation.

For flutter tonguing in the middle chalumeau register, higher partials disappear compared to the regular sounding frequencies. The tongue acts as a filter in this case, clearing the higher partials. This technique can be relatively easy or difficult.

The lower joint is a prime example of how changing the effective tube length causes alterations in pitch and intervallic relationships between notes.
